QFCgi
=====

[FastCGI][1] implementation for the [Qt project][2]. The library utilizes the
Qt event pattern, it runs completely asynchronous. It hides (most) of the
FastCGI specification behind a simple interface.

Usage
-----

A common pattern can look like this:

    #include <qfcgi.h>                                      // (1)

    QFCgi *fcgi = new QFCgi;                                // (2)
    fcgi->configureListen(QHostAddress::Any, 9000);         // (3)
    fcgi->start();                                          // (4)
    connect(fcgi, SIGNAL(newRequest(QFCgiRequest*)), ...);  // (5)

1. Include the [`qfcgi.h`](src/qfcgi.h) header.
2. Create an instance of the [`QFCgi`](src/fcgi.h) class.
3. Configure the listener. There are several listener available.
4. Start the FastCGI system.
5. Wait for incoming requests.
